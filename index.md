# Aerospace Computing Resources

**University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**

Welcome! This website aims to help increase and support computational literacy within the AE department. Computational literacy and computational thinking involve the following skills:

- problem-solving through decomposition, heuristic reasoning, algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, recursion, and more,
- effectively using digital tools and platforms to solve problems,
- collect, analyze, manage, visualize, and communicate data,
- translate domain knowledge into a mathematical model.

A common misconception about computational literacy is that these skills are exclusively relevant to, or even the same as, the field of computer science. However, computational literacy is essential to a wide range of fields, especially where quantitative and data-centric problems are involved. We hope this website will serve as a useful resource for you throughout your aerospace studies.
